# Vodka

INCOMPLETE. Catcon in go with a better name.

    $ gomake && 6l _go_.6
    $ ./6.out
    Vodka REPL, CTRL+C or type 'quit' to quit
    >> 10 30 + 5 *
    => 200
    >> 1 2 3 4 size
    => 5
    >> top
    => [200, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >> drop
    => []
    >> quit
    $

## Notes

- It isn't complete.
- This won't be a 1-1 clone of catcon.
- I'm new to go.
